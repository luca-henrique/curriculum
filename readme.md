# Curriculum Vitae

Welcome to my Curriculum Vitae repository! This repository contains my CV in various formats, along with the source files used to generate them.

## Contents

*   `Lucas_Borges_CV.pdf`: My CV in PDF format. This is the primary document you'll want to view.
*   `Lucas_Borges_CV.tex`: The LaTeX source file for my CV.
*   `Lucas_Borges_CV.md`: A markdown version of my CV (generated from the LaTeX source).
*   `generate.sh`: A simple shell script to generate the PDF and markdown versions from the LaTeX source.

## How to Generate the CV

If you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX), you can generate the PDF and markdown versions of the CV yourself.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luca-henrique/curriculum.git
    cd curriculum
    ```

2.  **Run the generation script:**
    ```bash
    ./generate.sh
    ```
    This script uses `pdflatex` to compile the `.tex` file into a PDF and `pandoc` to convert the `.tex` file to markdown.
